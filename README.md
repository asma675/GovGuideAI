## 🔍 **What GovGuide AI Does**

Government policies and forms are often long, confusing, and difficult to navigate.
GovGuide AI provides real-time assistance by:

* 📝 Summarizing policy or form text in clear, plain language
* 🧾 Detecting obligations, eligibility rules, required documents, and next steps
* 🔍 Offering explainable breakdowns
* 🌐 Supporting bilingual deployment (English/French ready)
* ⚖️ Following responsible AI principles (no personal data stored)
* 🔒 Providing transparent, non-decision-making guidance for users

This tool does **not** make legal decisions — it simply clarifies and explains.

## 🛠 **Tech Stack**

* **React 18** (Create React App)
* **HTML / CSS / JS**
* **Custom Glow UI**, accessible, purple gov-theme
* Pure client-side analysis (no backend required)

---

## 🎨 **UI Features**

* Accessible, high-contrast, government-ready design
* Beautiful purple-glow aesthetic
* Fully responsive layout
* Explained sections:

  * High-Level Summary
  * Key Obligations
  * Eligibility Signals
  * Required Documents
  * Suggested Steps & Actions

## ⚙️ **How It Works**

GovGuide AI uses simple rule-based analysis to simulate explainable AI:

* Text is parsed and cleaned
* Sentences are categorized using pattern detection
* Lists are generated directly from user-provided text
* No data is stored, transmitted, logged, or kept

This ensures **privacy**, **responsible AI**, and **zero sensitive information** processing.
